\section{Summary}
{\small
3rd-year Computer Science student at PJATK (Polish--Japanese Academy of Information Technology) with a growing focus on Python and Java backend development. I’m passionate about writing clean and efficient code, exploring scalable architectures, and building real-world projects that make an impact. Beyond programming, I enjoy photography -- it teaches me to see patterns, composition, and balance, which I bring into my software work. Constantly learning and improving.
